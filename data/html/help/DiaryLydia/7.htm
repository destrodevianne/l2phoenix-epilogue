!Diary Lydia:

All dead.

At last I could see Nidrah, using some of the terrible trick, I will not divulge here!

I simply must see it!

Only it was my hope!

He agreed to meet me even if I shall come to during the ceremony!

He reminded me of what I said earlier.

He said that I was brave and act!

I'm sure now that the time is right!
