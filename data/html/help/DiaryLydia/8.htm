!Diary Lydia:

Deeps darkness.

Starlight reflected in his smile.

He speaks of courage, but I do not know where or even who I am!

Maybe mad man can be brave?

Who knows?

His laughter is heard, and again, the word courage.

Other words, but they are in another language, I do not understand.

Dark Magician with his smile speaks softly to me, holding my hands in the dark night.

Courage.

Courage.

Courage.

Nothing else is irrelevant.

My ceremony is still ready!

What's going on here so late?
