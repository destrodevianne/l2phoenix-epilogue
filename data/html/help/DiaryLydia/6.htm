!Diary Lydia:

Twenty-fourth day of Shilen.

Quickly delivered my invitation to Nidrah, and he took it too easy!

I hurry when compiled with when he arrives!

I had to make a thousand mistakes, but he nirazu nepozhalovalsya!

He was too nice?

Or maybe it just all the same!

He told me that he was there on business and the case neimeet nothing obshego with our family.
