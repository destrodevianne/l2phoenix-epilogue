!Diary Lydia:

Tenth day of the month Shilen.

My father was very busy lately.

He and my brother posorilis last night!

Customers come in this afternoon.

Normally, it should offer a refreshing and a little conversation, but today.

He had just accompanied them to himself in the monastery!

What happened to him?
