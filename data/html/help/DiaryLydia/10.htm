!Diary Lydia:

I do not understand why I'm here!

I think he knows all my most secret secrets!

He asked that I do not want to leave.

I was Cesna with him, but I can not remember what I said.

All that was...

I lost it!

Make that really happen?

He asked that I gave all of myself to this!

He accuses me of betraying my family, my life, my God, and even the natural law!
