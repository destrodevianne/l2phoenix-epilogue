!Diary Lydia:

Thirtieth day of the month Shilen.

Tomorrow big day!

I nesmogla talk with the Father.

Word Nidrah'a now has too many values!

Royal Guide Run'y raslableny for all eternity, and that something must have happened!

Brother Eilhalder said that our family must first get on Run'y protection, rather than the royal family!

I'm not sure, and do not believe in all this...

Nidrah came to see me this evening.

He Inform me that no matter what I decided I should always show their courage during the terrible time.

What did he mean by that?

I have always been brave!
